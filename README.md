obs.js
======

Minimalist observable properties inspired by knockout.js.

This module is AMD and CommonJS compatible and should work with Node.js and modern browsers.

If you want to use the library in legacy browsers make sure to use an EcmaScript polyfill like [augment.js](http://augmentjs.com).

The implementation is straightforward, but is currently lacking a test suite and thus should not be considered production ready.
